# Overview of the Project
## Project Title
CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION

## Objective
Develop a fraud detection model to identify fraudulent credit card
transactions. Use techniques like anomaly detection or supervised
learning with imbalanced data.

## Key Activities
- Data cleaning and preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalizing features, and removing outliers.
- Feature selection: Identifying key features related to fraud detection to optimize model performance.
- Model training and evaluation: Training multiple models like Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), and evaluating them using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Hyperparameter tuning: Experimenting with different hyperparameters for each model to optimize their performance.
- Anomaly detection: Using unsupervised learning models to detect fraud by identifying unusual patterns in the dataset.
## Technology Used
- Python: For implementing the models and data analysis.
- Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms such as Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
- Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- NumPy: For numerical operations.
- Matplotlib/Seaborn: For visualizing the dataset and model performance (if visualizations were included).
- Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook: For running and documenting the project.
